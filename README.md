# TextFSM Generator
**TextFSM Generator** is a Python library designed to simplify and standardize the creation of TextFSM templates. It automatically generates templates from user-provided snippets, functioning in a way similar to AI prompts. The snippets are written in plain, English‑readable form, making them easy to understand, reuse, and share across teams. This approach enables developers, testers, engineers, QA professionals, and other collaborators to work more effectively together. By reducing the complexity of manual template creation, TextFSM Generator helps streamline workflows, improve consistency, and enhance overall efficiency in the development and testing process.
